# Power Systems and Power Electronics

The course content for ANU's [ENGN4625/6625](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/ENGN4625) can be found here.
The power electronics sections are based on the lecture notes by Bruce Erickson, and the power systems ones are based on the lecture notes by James Kirtley.

For more information it is recommended that the students check out the following text books:

- Erickson, Robert W., and Dragan Maksimovic. Fundamentals of power electronics. Springer Science & Business Media, 2007.
- Kirtley, James L. Electric power principles: sources, conversion, distribution and use. John Wiley & Sons, 2020.

One way to describe this course is to call it an introduction to _Power Processing_ in the same way that we might have heard the word _signal processing_.
It is about understanding, analysing, and designing systems that make it possible to transfer power from a source to users. We rely on our understanding of electric circuit theory to make sense of this process.
